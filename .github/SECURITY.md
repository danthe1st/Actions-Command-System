# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security vulnerabilities should **not** be reported as an issue on github because anyone can see that issue and use the vulnerability.

On the other hand, Security vulnerabilities should be reported **as fast as possible**.

Security vulnerabilities should be sent to [daniel@wwwmaster.at](mailto:daniel@wwwmaster.at)
