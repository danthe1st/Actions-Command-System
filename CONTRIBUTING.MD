The first line of every script should contain the executing shell (most likely `#!/bin/bash`). A documentation should follow after that. Every line of the documentation should start with `# ‍` (a hash symbol followed by a space). After that start, the line should be valid markdown. The documentation ends with the first line that does not start with `# ‍` (a hash symbol followed by a space).

If you just want to test, you can create your own project using this action or use issue [#1](https://github.com/danthe1st/ActionsTest/issues/1) or pull request [#2](https://github.com/danthe1st/ActionsTest/pull/2).

Do not use/create other issues/PRs just for testing!
